I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University, Shanghai, China, working with Prof. [Lingli Wang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/info/detail?id=178). I received B.S. in [Electronic science and technology](http://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/) from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2019.

My current research interests include FPGA architecture and CAD algorithms.
