I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, working with Prof. Lingli Wang. I received B.S. in Electronic science and technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2019.

My current research interests include FPGA architecture and CAD algorithms.
